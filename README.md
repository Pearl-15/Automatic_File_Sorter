Automatic File Organization

# File Organization Workflow
This guide explains the process of organizing files that were previously mixed in a **documents** folder. The goal is to improve file management by categorizing them into relevant folders.

## ðŸ“Œ Before: Unorganized Files
Initially, all files were stored together in a single folder, making it difficult to manage.

## ðŸ›  Step 1: Create Folders
To organize the files, we first create separate folders:
- ðŸ“‚ `image_files/` â†’ For all **image** files (e.g., `.png`)
- ðŸ“‚ `csv_files/` â†’ For all **CSV** files (e.g., `.csv`)
- ðŸ“‚ `excel_files/` â†’ For all **Excel** files (e.g., `.xlsx`)
- ðŸ“‚ `text_files/` â†’ For all **Text** files (e.g., `.txt`)

## ðŸš€ Step 2: Move Files into Relative Folders
Once the folders are created, the files are moved accordingly:
- **All `.csv` files** â†’ `csv_files/`
- **All `.xlsx` files** â†’ `excel_files/`
- **All `.png` files** â†’ `image_files/`
- **All `.txt` files** â†’ `text_files/`

The files are now well-organized, making it easier to find and manage them efficiently.
